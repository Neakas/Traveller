    <Name>Jack-of-All-Trades</Name>
    <Description>The Jack-of-All-Trades Skill works differently to other
Skills. It reduces the unSkilled penalty a Traveller
receives for not having the appropriate Skill by one
for every level of Jack-of-All-Trades. For example, if a
Traveller does not have the Pilot Skill, he suffers DM-3 to
all Pilot checks. If that Traveller has Jack-of-All-Trades
2, then the penalty is reduced by 2 to DM-1. With Jackof-
All-Trades 3, a Traveller can totally negate the penalty
for being unSkilled.
There is no benefit for having Jack-of-All-Trades 0 or
Jack-of-All-Trades 4 or more.</Description>

    <Name>Language</Name>
    <Description>There are numerous different Language specialities,
each one covering reading and writing a different
language. All Travellers can speak and read their
native language without needing the Language Skill,
and automated computer translator programs mean
Language Skills are not always needed on other
worlds. Having Language 0 implies the Traveller has a
smattering of simple phrases in several languages.

    <Name>Profession</Name>
    <Description>A Traveller with a Profession Skill is trained in producing
useful goods or services. There are many different
Profession specialities, but each one works the same
way – the Traveller can make a Profession check to earn
money on a planet that supports that trade. The amount
of money raised is Cr250 x the Effect of the check per
month. Unlike other Skills with specialties, levels in
the Profession Skill do not grant the ability to use other
specialties at level 0. Each specialty must be learned
individually. Someone with a Profession Skill of 0 has a
general grasp of working for a living but little experience
beyond the most menial jobs.
There are a huge range of potential specialities for this
Skill, one for every possible profession in the universe.
Some examples suitable to a science fiction setting are
given here. Also note that on some worlds other Skills,
such as Animals or Computer, may be used to earn a
living in the same manner as Profession Skills.</Description>
